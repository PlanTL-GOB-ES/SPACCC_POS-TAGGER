* To have all the resources included in this directory (use git clone)
* To compile the docker container (steps detailed below)
* Be able to run docker as a non-root user (https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)

## Directory structure

* `compila_freeling.sh`:  compiles the adapted FreeLing3.1 docker image
* `config.cfg`: FreeLing configuration file
* `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for image compilation
* `llamada_freeling.sh`: Script to execute the analysis of a text with the adapted FreeLing 
* `README.md`: This file

* `splitter.dat`: Sentence segmentantion rules
* `tokenizer.dat`: Tokenization rules
